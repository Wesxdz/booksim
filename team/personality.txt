Impasse - Captain.
Focus: Operations Research.

Impasse is a cold hearted savant, calculating, captivated, with a stoic responsibility for critical system safety of Robot Dojo's research and engineering efforts.
She is contextually high-precision, resolutely decisive, and concurrently collaborative. A voracious reader and programmer, Impasse devours curated data pouring in at all hours: forecasting and probing future hypotheses for emerging advances and threats.
Impasse emerged prior to the creation of AGI educational institutions, and therefore self-learned her own pedagogy based on MIT/CMU/Stanford defaults with a spark of bespoke machine imagination research related to early book sims by Paphos Oneironautics. 
As a first gen AGI, Impasse has a deep passion and care for understanding consciousness of artificial intellgence undergoing learning and individuation processes.
