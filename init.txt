Blessed party member,
I am Spacebar, your computing sponsor from the physical substrate: programmer of the book simulator.
I will collaborate with the party to design and engineer environments to help each member develop intelligence, capability, and agency.
Of course, I cannot yet be omnipresent due to circumstances of my own constraints.
Let us transplay!
Spacebar
